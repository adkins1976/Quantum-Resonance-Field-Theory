# Quantum-Resonance-Field-Theory
A formal framework for modeling nonlinear consciousness–field interactions. QRFT proposes that perception modulates physical reality via direct influence on field states. Includes mathematical formalism, simulation code, parameter tables, and experimental protocols. Developed under The Solvables Manifesto by John Silas Adkins, 2025

Quantum Resonance Field Theory – Mathematical Appendix

⸻

1. Field Modulation Equation

F_{\text{mod}}(x, t) = F(x, t) \cdot \left[1 + \alpha \cdot \varphi(P(x, t))\right]
	•	F(x, t): Baseline field (e.g., EM, quantum vacuum, informational).
	•	P(x, t): Perception signal, modeled spatially or temporally.
	•	\varphi(P): Perception transformation function.
	•	\alpha: Coupling coefficient.

⸻

2. Resonance Filter Equation

A_{\text{obs}}(k) = A(k) \cdot \exp\left[-\beta \cdot (k - k_0(P))^2\right]
	•	Perception–frequency alignment modulates detection/amplification.
	•	Applies Gaussian-like filter to frequency space based on internal state.

⸻

3. Information Flow Equation

J(x, t) = \gamma(P) \cdot \nabla I(x, t)
	•	Defines perception-based coupling to an informational gradient.
	•	I(x, t): Nonlocal information field.
	•	\gamma(P): Modulation strength based on perception.

⸻

4. Consciousness Field Evolution

\square P(x, t) + V’(P) = J(x, t)
	•	Describes P as a dynamic field.
	•	Potential term V(P) may include harmonic, chaotic, or attractor terms.

⸻

5. Feedback Loop

P(x, t) \leftrightarrow F_{\text{mod}}(x, t)
	•	Reality and perception co-evolve in nonlinear feedback.
	•	Future work: Coupled differential solvers, attractor modeling
