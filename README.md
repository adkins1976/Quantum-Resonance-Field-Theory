# Quantum-Resonance-Field-Theory
A formal framework for modeling nonlinear consciousnessâ€“field interactions. QRFT proposes that perception modulates physical reality via direct influence on field states. Includes mathematical formalism, simulation code, parameter tables, and experimental protocols. Developed under The Solvables Manifesto by John Silas Adkins, 2025
